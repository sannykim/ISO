The three primary functions of the app:
1. **The app alerts the elderly to exercise.** It uses anomaly detection algorithm to identify the movement of the phone or wearable device wore on the senior citizen, and when the device is not moving during the time it should be, it will show the alert. It also tracks and shows the long-term exercising habit of the elderly.
